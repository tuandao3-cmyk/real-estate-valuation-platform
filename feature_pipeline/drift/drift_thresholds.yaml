governance_statement: >
  Drift thresholds defined in this file are descriptive reference values
  intended solely for human interpretation, audit discussion, and model
  risk review. They MUST NOT be used directly or indirectly to trigger
  automated decisions, alerts, retraining, approval, or rejection.

applicable_metrics:
  - PSI
  - KS_STATISTIC

psi_reference_bands:
  VERY_LOW:
    range: [0.0, 0.05]
    description: >
      Negligible distribution change.
      Typically observed in stable production environments.
  LOW:
    range: [0.05, 0.1]
    description: >
      Minor shift. Worth monitoring during routine review.
  MEDIUM:
    range: [0.1, 0.25]
    description: >
      Noticeable distribution drift.
      Requires human analysis and contextual explanation.
  HIGH:
    range: [0.25, null]
    description: >
      Significant distribution shift.
      Must be escalated to Model Risk / Governance review.
      No automatic action permitted.

ks_reference_bands:
  LOW:
    range: [0.0, 0.1]
    description: >
      Small statistical distance between distributions.
  MEDIUM:
    range: [0.1, 0.2]
    description: >
      Moderate distributional difference.
      Interpretation depends on feature criticality and context.
  HIGH:
    range: [0.2, null]
    description: >
      Large distributional difference.
      Requires formal review by model owners and MRM.

interpretation_rules:
  - rule: "No single metric is sufficient"
    explanation: >
      PSI or KS must never be interpreted in isolation.
      Context, feature role, and business impact are mandatory.
  - rule: "Drift does not imply model failure"
    explanation: >
      Observed drift does not automatically indicate degraded model
      performance or invalid valuation outputs.
  - rule: "Human authority is final"
    explanation: >
      All drift interpretation and resulting actions must be decided
      by authorized human reviewers.

  owner_team: "Model Risk Management"
  approval_required_for_change: true
  change_process: >
    Any modification requires version bump, written rationale,
    and governance committee approval.
