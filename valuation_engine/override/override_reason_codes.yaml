description: >
  Canonical, governance-approved list of override reason codes.
  These codes define the ONLY acceptable justifications for human override
  within the valuation workflow.

  This file is STATIC and NON-COMPUTATIONAL.
  It does not evaluate, decide, or approve overrides.
  It only enumerates allowed reason codes for audit and legal traceability.

core_principles:
  - valuation_dossier.json is the Single Source of Truth
  - Human authority only
  - No inference, no computation, no auto-approval
  - If conflict arises: valuation_dossier.json OVERRIDES ALL
