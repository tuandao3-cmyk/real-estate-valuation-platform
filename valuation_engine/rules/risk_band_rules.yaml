role: "Risk Band Routing Policy (Rule-only)"

description: >
  Defines workflow routing and control intensity based on
  pre-assessed risk bands. This policy does not compute risk,
  does not adjust valuation outputs, and does not make approval
  decisions. It only routes cases to appropriate human controls.
